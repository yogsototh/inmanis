What is your biggest dream?
Do you plan to make a lot of money? Become famous?
Sorry but these are shitty dreams!
Having money, be popular or famous.
These should be means, not goals.

What were your child dreams?
Fly? 
Live almost eternally? 
Discover new life form?
Travel into space?
Create the first friendly AI?

Of course all these dream are very naives.
Of course most won't be true soon or later.
But don't you see our greatest brain lose their energy 
toward making customer clicking on ads?
Isn't it sad?

I propose to make this website to make find again great dreams. 
Even if the dream seems impossible to achieve. 
We will plan the necessary steps. 
And we will work to finish these step.

This website is all about slow web. 
Our brain are constantly stimulated by new informations. 
You know which ones, lolcats, reddit pics, etc...
